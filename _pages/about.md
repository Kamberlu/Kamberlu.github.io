Hello! I am an MBA Student at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/). I have a background in conservation with the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game and am a [Returned Peace Corps](https://www.facebook.com/peacecorpsmacedonia/videos/we-are-live-at-the-swearing-in-ceremony-of-the-24th-group-of-peace-corps-volunte/449672655751828/) [Volunteer](https://youtu.be/348IRG8tvuc?t=343) (RPCV) from North Macedonia.

I am originally from [Wasilla, Alaska](https://www.frontiersman.com/kamber-lucas/image_114ea9da-af63-11e4-a34d-4bfda50ae2f9.html) and I attended the [University of Wyoming for my B.S. in Management](https://www.uwyo.edu/mgtmkt/index.html) w/minor in [statistics](https://www.uwyo.edu/mathstats/) and am currently persuing my [MBA](https://biz.colostate.edu/academics/graduate-programs/mba/impact-mba/corporate-sustainability) with a focus on carbon management and sustainability. I am also currently a Registered Investment Advisor in the state of Colorado.

My overall goals post graduate school would be to work in large scale food systems driving the transition from industrial agriculture to [regenerative agriculture](https://wwoofusa.org/user/766091), or to [work](https://www.beyondwealthmanagement.com/blog-01/what-values-based-investing) in finance developing sustainable investment solutions.
